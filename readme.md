# Python wrapper for LibCompress (C)

## Introduction

The project is based on [ctypes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html), a foreign function library for **Python**.  
It provides **C** compatible data types, and allows calling functions in **DLLs** or **shared libraries**.

## LibCompress (Huffman Coding)

In computer science and information theory, a **Huffman code** is a particular type of **optimal prefix** code that is commonly used for data compression.  
**Huffman coding**, introduced by **David A. Huffman** in 1952, remains one of the most efficient and widely used algorithms for **lossless** data compression.  
Its strength lies in assigning shorter binary codes to more frequent symbols, thereby reducing the overall size of the encoded data.

Despite its age, **Huffman coding** is still relevant today, forming the basis of compression techniques used in formats like **DEFLATE**.
